    "Welcome!🎪 You will turn in your assignment by making changes on this Jupyter Notebook file which is already saved on your Github repository after you accepted my invitation for the assignment. You will work on this file locally. (You can either manually download the files from the online repo, or \"clone\" it via \"Code\">\"Open with Github Desktop\" which downloads a local copy for you, and makes \"committing\" easier.) Once you finish and you are ready to submit, go to Github and \"commit\" + \"push\" to turn in your assignment. Make sure to submit two things: Your completed assignment **as a Markdown file** and the source **.ipynb file**.\n",

    "I will grade your assignment by opening your \"hw0.ipynb\" file in Jupyter (in a directory containing all required data files), clicking \"Kernel > Restart & Run All\", reading the output, and reading your \"hw0.md\" file. Any code that fails to run due to errors receives a 0, so make sure to \"Restart & Run All\" your file and verify that all code runs without any issues before you submit.\n",

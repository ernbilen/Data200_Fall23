#  Benefits of JSON 

::: {.incremental}
+ Programmer familiarity: The notation/syntax is a close match for how programmers define data.
+ Readability: The format is text-based so the data is readable and editable directly in a text editor.
+ Lightweight but powerful: The notation is simple but can handle complex situations.

#  JSON Data Structure Example 

::: small
::: monospace
{ <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"firstName": "Jane", <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"lastName": "Doe", <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"hobbies": ["running", "sky diving", "singing"], <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"age": 35, <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"children": [ <br>
$\hspace{2cm}${ <br>
$\hspace{3cm}$"firstName": "Alice", <br>
$\hspace{3cm}$"age": 6 <br>
$\hspace{2cm}$}, <br>
$\hspace{2cm}${ <br>
$\hspace{3cm}$"firstName": "Bob", <br>
$\hspace{3cm}$"age": 8 <br>
$\hspace{2cm}$} <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$] <br>
} <br>

+ This looks almost identical to a Python ________! :blue_book:


#  Python Supports JSON Natively 

+ Python comes with a built-in package called `json` for encoding and decoding JSON data. <br>
 `import json`
+ Encoding means _writing_ data to disk; decoding means _reading_ data into memory.


#  Serializing JSON 

+ Python objects to JSON translation:

```{r tbl4, echo = FALSE}
tbl4 <- tibble::tribble(
~`Python`, ~`JSON`,
"dict","object",
"list, tuple","array",
"str","string",
"int, long, float","number",
"True","true",
"False","false",
"None","null"
)

kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(tbl4), font_size = 18)
```


#  Serialization Example
::: r-stack
::: monospace
import json <br>
data = { <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$"president": { <br>
$\hspace{2cm}$"name": "Zaphod Beeblebrox", <br>
$\hspace{2cm}$"species": "Betelgeusian" <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$} <br>
} <br>
with open("data_file.json", "w") as write_file: <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$json.dump(data, write_file) <br>
![](assets/img/hitchiker.png){.fragment fragment-index=2 .absolute bottom="-30" right="20" width="400"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3 .absolute bottom="10" right="200"}

#  Deserializing JSON 
::: monospace
with open("data_file.json", "r") as read_file: <br>
$\hspace{1cm}$ data = json.load(read_file)
:::
+ The result of the `load(.)` call is able to return any of the allowed data types from the conversion table.
	+ We will explore JSON more later in the course.
	+ Let's now talk about Tabular Model.


#  Tabular Model: Structure and Formats 

A data model has the following defining characteristics

- the _structure_ of the data,
- the _operations_ to obtain and update data within the model,
- _constraints_ that, within the model, limit the data in various ways.

. . .

::: r-stack
- **Tabular data** is data that is structured into rows and columns. Each row contains information from a person, object etc.
	- In tabular data, cells within the same column provide information on the <u> same characteristic </u> of the things described by each row.

#  Tidy Data 

Def: A data set in the tabular data model is said to be **tidy data** if it
conforms to the following.

+ Each column represents exactly one variable of the data set. **(TidyData 1)**
+ Each row represents exactly one unique mapping (observation) **(TidyData2)**
+ Each value must have its own cell. **(TidyData3)**

. . .

#  Top Baby Names 
::: {.column width="45%"}
![](assets/img/image3.png)
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
+ There are alternate ways that this data set could be represented in a tabular format.
:::


#  Tidy Data? 
::: {.column width="85%"}
![](assets/img/image4.png)
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .incremental}
+ We can see columns headed up by year values, so that we are violating **TidyData1**--the columns here are not variables.
:::

#  Tidy Data? 

![](assets/img/image5.png)

::: incremental
+ Note that the columns like `FemaleName` do not represent exactly one variable.

+ The name of the column itself shows two parts, one of which is a value of a categorical variable, and the other part is a variable that is then repeated in `MaleName`.

+ This is a violation of **TidyData1**.
:::


#  Tidy Data? 
![](assets/img/image6.png)

+ Only the original table, Table 6.1, satisfies all three requirements of tidy data.
+ Later in the semester, we will learn pivoting and melting, which are tools to make data untidy data tidy.



#  Format 

Files stored in a computer can come in different formats.
Examples: `jpg, mp3, docx, mov`

+ The most common format for **tabular data** is **the comma-separated value (CSV)** format.


#  CSV Format
::: incremental
+ CSV strikes a nice balance between being readable by humans and readable by computers.
+ CSV is a tabular format consisting of rows of data, each row containing multiple cells. Rows are separated by line terminators, so each row corresponds to one line.
+ The CSV format assumes exactly one tabular structure per separate file.
    + This is more constrained than a spreadsheet model, in which a single file can contain multiple worksheets that could each hold its own tabular structure.
+ CSV is a text-based format, i.e., a CSV file is a text file.
:::

#  Typical Structure of CSV 
+ One header row, which gives the names of the columns.
+ May rows of data.
  + One row of data is encoded in one line of the file.
  + Values are separated by commas.
+ Sometimes a \# is used for comment lines. (although rarely)

#  CSV Example 

+ Header row: <br>

::: monospace
 LastName , FirstName, Initial, Course, Time
:::

+ Data (subsequent rows): <br>

::: monospace
 Lauer, Hugh, C, CS-1004, 0800 <br>
 Wills, Craig, E, CS-3013, 1200 <br>
 Hamel, Glynis, M, CS-1101, 1000 <br>

#  Tabular Data in Python 

+ We could represent tabular data in Python with native built-in data structures using a _dictionary of lists (DoL)_  or a _lists of lists (LoL)_.
+ As we will see, these approaches have distinct disadvantages.


#  Dictionary of Lists (DoL) 

+ We could represent tabular data in Python using a dictionary of lists (DoL):

::: {.column width=45%}
![](assets/img/image7.png)
:::
::: {.column width=45%}
+ This is effective for accessing and manipulating entire columns but working with rows requires additional code.
:::

#  Dictionary of Lists (DoL)

![](assets/img/image9.png)


#  List of Lists (LoL) 

+ We could also represent tabular data in Python using a list of lists (LoL):

::: {.column width=45%}
![](assets/img/image7.png)
:::
::: {.column width=45%}
+ While effective for dealing by rows, there is more work for manipulating columns.

#  Pandas 
::: r-stack
+ Pandas Dataframe is the solution!!
+ The need for Python data structures to handle tabular data has led to the development of the pandas module.
+ Let's begin learning Pandas!

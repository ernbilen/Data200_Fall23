# Operating Systems

-   Operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux have similar
    file system structures.

-   Files can be anything; source programs, executable problems,
    libraries, media, data...

    -   One program can create a file and another program can read and
        process the file.

# Hierarchical Organization

-   Operating systems utilize a hierarchical organization to organize
    files.

    -   A tree, with the root and interior nodes of the tree
    -   Each folder can have contents, which are the children of the node in the
        tree.
    -   The children contents of a folder can have zero or more files
        (and/or zero or more (sub)folders.)
    -   A leaf is a node with no children.

    

# 

![](assets/img/image4.png)

-   Note: "..." represents a sub-tree not pictured.

-   The "/" denotes the root of the file system

**True/False?** A file must be a leaf on the tree.

# 

![](assets/img/image5.png){height="3.8in"}

-   Here we focus on the user $\texttt{alice}$ and the subtree in the
    file system that shows her home directory.

# 

![](assets/img/image6.png)

-   Above is what we might see using a File Explorer on a Mac after
    navigating to Alice's the $\texttt{Documents}$ folder.

-   It's important to realize that the File Explorer is not the only
    interface to the underlying file system structure.

. . .

-   For example, files and folders can also be accessed directly using
    applications such as Terminal on MacOS or Command Prompt on Windows.

Demo time!


# Paths

-   A **path** starts at one node called the **source node**, and ends
    at another node called the **destination node.**
-   The destination node could be a file or a directory node.

# File Paths

-   A file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It's
    broken up into three major parts:

    -   **Folder Path:** the file folder location on the file system
        where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash /
        (Unix or Mac) or backslash \\ (Windows).
    -   **File Name:** the actual name of the file.
    -   **Extension**: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period
        (.) used to indicate the file type.

# 

![](assets/img/image7.png)

# Path Separator Convention

-   On the previous slide, we used the MacOS and Linux convention of
    forward slash ( / ) as the path separator and / for the root.
-   Windows uses $\texttt{<disk letter>:\ }$ for specifying a file
    system tree root, and backslash ( \\ ) as the separator in paths.

# Working Directory

-   Whenever we execute our programs, the operating system maintains a
    concept of a working directory .
-   Often, the working directory is initialized as the folder in which
    the file representing the program or executable resides.
-   How is this related to Jupyter Notebook?

# 

![](assets/img/image8.png)

Cool trick:

-   Suppose the current working directory is: [/home/alice/Documents]{.yellow style="font-family: monospace;"}

-   The path [./firstyear/ma135]{.blue style="font-family: monospace;"} defines the traversal:

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
[/home/alice/Documents]{.yellow style="font-family: monospace;"}[/firstyear/ma123]{.blue style="font-family: monospace;"}
:::
-   The path [../Pictures/profile.jpg]{style="font-family:monospace; color:purple;"} defines the traversal:

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
[/home/alice]{style="font-family:monospace; color:green;"}[/Pictures/profile.jpg]{style="font-family:monospace; color:purple;"} :wrench:Notice [Documents]{.yellow .monospace} is absent.

# Opening a File in Python

::: r-stack
::: {.fragment fragment-index="1" style="padding-right: 340px;"}
-   Before you can work with a file, you must open it.
:::

![](assets/img/yoda.jpg){.fragment .absolute fragment-index="2"
bottom="370" right="77" width="4in" height="3in"}
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index="3"}
-   In Python we can use the built-in `open(.)` function. It takes, as
    arguments, a string specifying a path to a file, and a second string
    that specifies in what way the program will use the file, known as
    its mode .

-   The `open(.)` function creates and returns a file object, which can
    be used to call other file support methods. <br> $\hspace{1cm}$
    `file = open('hello.txt', 'r')` <br> <u>hello.txt</u> <br> Hello
    World!
:::

# Access Modes

![](assets/img/image9.png)

# Access Modes

-   In Python modes, we use `'t'` for text files, and `'b'` for binary
    files. A mode can include both the form of access as well as the
    file type, so a mode of `'rt'` would be used for read access to a
    text file, or a mode of `'wb'` would be used for write access to a
    binary file.

    -   The default mode for `open(.)` is `'rt'` and can be omitted if
        this is the desired mode. `open('hello.txt')`

# OS Module in Python

-   The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the
    operating system. For example: `import os` <br> `os.getcwd()` Gets
    the current working directory <br> `os.chdir('DataFolder')` Changes
    the current working directory <br> `os.mkdir('C:\\MyProject')` Makes
    a directory

# File Path as a String

-   Suppose we have a directory, referred to by the string `datadir`,
    that contains the file `hello.txt`: `datadir = '/home/ alice'`
-   We can use the `os.path.join(.)` method to concatenate various path
    components with exactly one directory separator ( / ) <br>
    `filepath = os.path.join(datadir,'hello.txt')`

# os.path.join Example

```{python eval=FALSE}
import os 
path = "/home" 
print(os.path.join(path,"User/Desktop","file.txt")) 

path = "User/Documents"
print(os.path.join(path, "/home", "file.txt")) 
```

Output: <br> `/home/User/Desktop/file.txt` <br> `/home/file.txt`

# Error Handling: Try Except

-   Below we demonstrate a simple try-except block that can handle the
    case where the file does not exist, or the user does not have
    sufficient permissions for the specified access mode for the file
    being opened. ![](assets/img/image10.png){width="5in"}

# Closing a File

-   When a program is finished with a file, you must call the `close(.)`
    method to allow the operating systems to clean up and release
    resources associated with the file connection: `file.close ()`

    -   Closing files is essential and forgetting to close files can
        have major negative consequences.
    
. . .

- You need to pay me a penny for each time you forget closing a file.

# File Position

-   Once you've opened a file, you'll want to read or write to it .

    -   The file position starts at line 0, which is the position at the very
        beginning of the file. When we perform any of a set of read-type
        operations, the operation reads in some number of characters and
        the file position is advanced.

# File Object Methods

![](assets/img/image11.png)

# Example

![](assets/img/image12.png)

-   The function `repr(.)` prints the representation of all the content
    of a string, including showing a `\n` for the newline.

# Another Example

<u>twolines.txt</u> <br> <font face="monospace"> First line </font> <br>
<font face="monospace"> A second line </font>

```{python,eval=F}
inputFile = open("twolines.txt") 
filecontents = inputFile.read() 
print(filecontents) 
print(repr(filecontents)) 
```

**Output:** <br> <font face="monospace"> This is the first line.</font>
<br> <font face="monospace"> This is the second line. </font> <br>
<font face="monospace"> 'This is the first line.\\nThis is the second
line.'</font>

# `readline(.)` Method

![](assets/img/image13.png)

Output: 

![](assets/img/image14.png)

# `strip(.)` and `rstrip(.)`

-   If we are processing a file by lines and want to remove whitespace
    and newline characters, we can use

    -   `strip(.)` to eliminate both leading and trailing whitespace in
        a string
    -   `rstrip(.)` to eliminate training whitespace in a string
        ![](assets/img/image15.png)

![](assets/img/image16.png)

# Another `strip(.)` Example

```{python,eval=F}
txt = "    banana    " 
x = txt.strip() 
print("of all fruits", x, "is my favorite") 
```

<u>Output:</u> <br> of all fruits banana is my favorite

# `split(.)` String Method

-   The `split(.)` method breaks a string at the specified separator and
    returns a list of strings.

    -   The default separator is any whitespace.

    ```{python,eval=F}
    text = "Python is a fun programming language" 
    print(text.split()) 
    ```

    <u>Output:</u> <br> <font face="monospace">\['Python', 'is', 'a',
    'fun', 'programming', 'language'\] </font>

# Another `split(.)` Example

::: monospace
grocery = 'Milk, Chicken, Bread'
:::

```{r tbl30, echo = FALSE}
tbl30 <- tibble::tribble(
~`Command`, ~`Output`,
"print(grocery.split())","[ ]",
"print(grocery.split(', '))","[ ]",
"print(grocery.split(','))","[ ]",
"print(grocery.split(':'))","[ ]"
)

kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(tbl30), font_size = 18, html_font = 'monospace')
```

# Methods for Ensuring a File is Closed

-   A very common error in file processing is to fail to include the
    `close(.)` for an open file.

    -   There are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is
        properly closed, even when encountering an error: `try-finally`
        block and a `with` statement.

# try-finally block

```{python, eval=F}
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt') 
try: 
  # Further file processing goes here 
finally: 
  reader.close() 
```

-   If you're unfamiliar with the `try-finally` block, check out the
    webpage [Python Exceptions: An
    Introduction](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)

# Using with Statement

```{python, eval=F}
with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader: 
  # Further file processing goes here 
```

-   The `with` statement automatically takes care of closing the file
    once it leaves the `with` block, even in cases of error.
-   Important::warning: It is highly recommended that you use the `with`
    statement as much as possible, as it allows for cleaner code and
    makes handling any unexpected errors easier for you.

# with Continued

-   Most likely, you'll also want to use the second positional argument,
    `mode`.

    -   This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to
        represent how you want to open the file. The default is
        read-only mode as a text file `'rt'`:

    ```{python, eval=F}
    with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader: 
      # Further file processing goes here
    ```

    <br>

    ```{r tbl35, echo = FALSE}
    tbl35 <- tibble::tribble(
    ~`Character`, ~`Meaning`,
    "'r'","Open for reading (default)",
    "'w'","Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first",
    "'rb' or 'wb'","Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)"
    )

    kableExtra::kable_styling(knitr::kable(tbl35), font_size = 18, html_font = 'monospace')
    ```

# readlines(.)Method

-   The `readlines(.)` method reads, in a single invocation, a list
    containing all the separate lines in a file.

::: monospace
<u>dog_breeds.txt</u> <br> Pug <br> Jack Russell Terrier <br> English
Springer Spaniel <br> German Shepherd <br> Staffordshire Bull Terrier
<br> Cavalier King Charles Spaniel <br> Golden Retriever <br> West

:::

# readlines(.)Example

```{python, eval=F}
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as file_obj: 
  lines = file_obj.readlines() 
  
for line in lines: 
  print(line, end='') 
```

:::
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: small
Note that the `print(.)` function stops with a newline. By default, the
value of this parameter is `\n`, but you can end a print statement with
any character. Here, we are ending it with no characters (this prevents
extra carriage returns in the output) Try playing around with this
option and see what it gets returned to you.

# Processing Files for Data

-   We now consider iterating over a file in order to process data
    contained therein as one or more lists.

-   We begin with the assumption that our file has one datum per line,
    and that the set of lines form a coherent collection.

# Baby Names

-   The file below contains the most popular female (baby) names, in
    rank order, registered in 2010 with the US Social Security
    Administration (SSA).

::: monospace
<u>Baby_2010_female_name.txt</u> <br> Isabella <br> Sophia <br> Emma
<br> Olivia <br> Ava
:::

-   Our first objective is to create a function that processes the file
    and returns a single Python list with a name per entry in the file.

# `readNames(.)` Example

![](assets/img/image19.png)

# `readNames(.)` Example

![](assets/img/image20.png)

# Read in All Lines

-   What if we wanted to process all the lines (names), rather than a
    set number.

    -   The pattern of processing a file by lines in an iterative
        manners is a very common practice.
    -   We can do this by allowing the file object itself to be an
        iterator.

# Iterating Example

![](assets/img/image21.png)

-   Note that the for-loop continues as long as there are lines, i.e.,
    until it has reached the end-of-file.

-   This method is typically quicker and more memory efficient.
    Therefore, it is the suggested way to process a file.

# Multiple Data Items per Line

-   File often store data with each line representing a single case or
    observation, and then within the line, there are multiple values of
    some variables for the observation

::: monospace
<u>Baby_2010_female_name.txt</u> <br> Isabella 22913 <br> Sophia 20643
<br> Emma 17345 <br> Olivia 17028 <br> Ava 15433 <br>
:::

-   Each line contains the name and then the number of babies registered
    with that name.

-   The name and the number are separated on each line with a single tab
    (`\t`)
